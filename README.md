# TASK-
MY first ever app  - I dont have any experience in app development so this is a first.
First of all i downloaded android studio and java development kit ( from oracle ,jdk-20).
Then proceeded on to setting up the environment variables accordingly ----> control panel----->system---->advanced setting ---->environment variables or just simply type edit the system environment variables in search bar in windows and there create a new variable that is %JAVA_HOME% in system variables and the url of JAVA files in jdk 20 , and add a new url of bin files in path variable.
Next we start our android studio , the existing codes pops up showing the already installed class MainActivity extending from AppCompatActivity. Now it is necessary to create a  device manager ( phone) ie an emulator where we can run our code and check if is properly functioning or not.
There are two things to be consisdered while developing the app , the code and design.
For designing , we can use the palette of the studio while also changing  the attributes of features to our liking .
I have specifically used the constraint layout as it is more efficient and beneficial than the relative layout.
Even though i have made a simple app , but i have done it in a day's time .
